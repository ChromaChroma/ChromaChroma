My name is Jona Leeflang. Online known as Chroma or ChromaChroma. I completed my BSc degree HBO-ICT at the  [University of Applied Sciences Utrecht](https://www.internationalhu.com/). 
Now I am continuing my involvement in research with a MSc degree in Computing Science at the [University Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/computing-science).

## 🔭 I’m currently working on 
- Cyclist Avoidance. A project with 4 others to introduce a cyclist comfort zone based collision avoidance for agent-based cyclist simulation. This project will include a simple simulation application.

## ✔️ Previous projects
- [Bartap](https://github.com/tungstun-ict). Together with a friend of mine, [Jort Willemsen](https://github.com/JortWillemsen), I have developed an application for (private) bar managements.
  This includes adding products, maintaining sessions during drinking, managing payments (not automated). I am responsible for the backend API of the project. 

- [Functional PacMan](https://github.com/ChromaChroma/Functional-Pacman). An implementation of the classical PacMan game using Haskell and Gloss. The implementation is backed by a dynamic tile loading mechnism that determines the sprite to load based on the level tile layout, allowing custom levels. (No custom level editor yet)

- CimSessions. An application to sign up for knowledge sessions and monitor the interest in sessions following BI & Data Science.  
  This was a school project commisioned to us by [CIMSOLUTIONS](https://www.cimsolutions.nl/).

### Hi there üëã

## About me  
My name is Jona Leeflang. Online commonly named as Chroma or ChromaChroma.
I graduated cum laude for my bachelor degree HBO-ICT at the University of applied sciences of Utrecht (HU).
Currently I am continuing my research experience with a masters degree in Computing Science at the University Utrecht.


## ‚úîÔ∏è Previous projects
- [Bartap]((https://github.com/tungstun-ict)). Together with a friend of mine, [Jort Willemsen](https://github.com/JortWillemsen), I have developed an application for (private) bar managements.
  This includes adding products, maintaining sessions during drinking, managing payments (not automated). I am responsible for the backend API of the project. 

- [Functional PacMan](https://github.com/ChromaChroma/haskell-game). An implementation of the classical PacMan game using Haskell and Gloss. The implementation is backed by a dynamic tile loading mechnism that determines the sprite to load based on the level tile layout, allowing custom levels. (No custom level editor yet)

- CimSessions. An application to sign up for knowledge sessions and monitor the interest in sessions following BI & Data Science.  
  This was a school project commisioned to us by [CIMSOLUTIONS](https://www.cimsolutions.nl/).


## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on 
- Cyclist Avoidance. A project with 4 others to introduce a cyclist comfort zone based collision avoidance for agent-based cyclist simulation. This project will include a simple simulation application.
